This repo consists of various small and large projects that I completed during my time in the Wyncode Programming Bootcamp.

1) FizzBuzz.rb => An automatic Fizz-Buzzer app. That will run through the famous programming question automatically after 
you provide the ranges!

2) botBattle.rb => An simple REPL game designed as a way to learn about functions. Allows users to fight against a bot with randomly generated health and power
